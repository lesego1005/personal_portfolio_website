# Portfolio Reflection

## What I Learned
In the 2-Month Bootcamp, I gained foundational skills across Generative AI, Low-Code Development, Data Engineering, and Cloud Fundamentals. Week 1 covered Git, Agile, and environment setup. Week 2 focused on prompt engineering with ChatGPT and Gemini, including AI ethics. Week 3 involved building Power Apps with AI assistance. Week 4 taught SQL and Python ETL pipelines. Weeks 5-6 prepared me for AWS Cloud Practitioner and AZ-900 certifications via hands-on labs. Week 7 introduced Docker and CI/CD. Week 8's capstone integrated all for a portfolio project. This broad exposure helped identify my interests for specialisation.

## My Technical Strengths
- **Generative AI**: Strong in prompt engineering and ethical AI application, as shown in mini-projects.
- **Low-Code**: Excelled in Power Apps and Automate.
- **Data Engineering**: Proficient in ETL with Python/Pandas.
- **Cloud**: Mastered AWS/Azure basics, with >70% on coursera assessments and deployments.
- **DevOps**: Skilled in containerisation and pipelines, adapting quickly to tools.

## How the Capstone Integrates Bootcamp Concepts
My capstone—a cloud-deployed AI-enhanced data pipeline—combined all domains: AI for code generation (Week 2), Power BI dashboard (Weeks 3/7), Python ETL to Azure SQL (Week 4), deployment on Azure Functions with security (Weeks 5-6), and Docker/CI/CD (Week 7). Agile planning (Week 1) guided iterations. It demonstrated interconnected tech, evaluated via demo and docs.

## My Goals Moving Forward
Specialise in Data Engineering post-bootcamp. Achieve AWS CCP and AZ-900 certifications. Build GitHub portfolio, network via CAPACITI events, and aim for a junior data engineer role by program end. Explore advanced AI in data ethically.
